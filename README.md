## Dataset<a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>

I've chosen the "Loan Data from Prosper" dataset as it strikes a good balance between size, complexity and richness. It has a lot of variables to chose from, both numerical and categorical and enough samples to provided meaningful results.

This data set contains information about 113937 loans from [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/) with 81 variables for each of them.
