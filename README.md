## Introduction<a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>

This repository contains my submission to the "Communicate Data Findings" project of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. These are the contents of the repository:

* README.md: This file.
* [Part_I_exploration.ipynb](Part_I_exploration.ipynb): Jupyter notebook containing the first part of the project where we perform the data wranging and exploratory analysis.
* [Part_II_slide_deck.ipynb](Part_II_slide_deck.ipynb): Jupyter notebook containing the second part of the project where we present the findings of the first part.
* [prosperLoanData.csv.zip](prosperLoanData.csv.zip): Compressed data set.
* [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): PyPI requirements file containing the dependencies needed to run the code of the notebooks.

## Dataset<a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>

I've chosen the "Loan Data from Prosper" dataset as it strikes a good balance between size, complexity and richness. It has a lot of variables to chose from, both numerical and categorical and enough samples to provided meaningful results.

This data set contains information about 113937 loans from [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/) with 81 variables for each of them.
